I like to do projects to explore data and learn new methods of performing research. Here are a few examples.

## [Arkansa Base Map](https://amwilkins.github.io/Ar-base.html)

- An RMarkdown presentation on the production of a simple base map layer.
- Creates a base map object for use in later data visualizations.
